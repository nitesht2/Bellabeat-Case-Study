# Bellabeat-Case-Study
In this case study, I will perform data analysis for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. I will analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. My analysis will help guide future marketing strategies for your team. As data analyst I will be following the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
